This is going to be a diagram editor built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), using Typescript. The project is still very much in its beginning stages, but you can access the current version at [`https://jplate.github.io/pasi`](https://jplate.github.io/pasi).

The origins of this project go back to late 2006, when I started writing a [Java applet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) that would allow me to create diagrams (using a GUI) and output LaTeX code for these same diagrams that I could then use in my philosophy papers. (At the time I was a PhD student in philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, having previously learned Java at Osnabrück and Exeter.) However, that project was barely done when applets started to become deprecated, and so I gave up on my plans for deploying this applet on a website. The source files for this earlier project are available [here](https://github.com/jplate/jPasi) under the MIT license.
