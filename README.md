This is a diagram editor built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It is still not quite done, but you can access the current version at [`https://jplate.github.io/pasi`](https://jplate.github.io/pasi).

The origins of this project go back to late 2006, when I started writing a [Java applet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) that would allow me to create diagrams (using a GUI) and output LaTeX code for these same diagrams that I could then use in my philosophy papers. (At the time I was a PhD student in philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, having previously studied cognitive science and computer science at Osnabr√ºck and Exeter.) However, that project was barely finished when applets were starting to become deprecated, and so I soon took the website offline. The source files for this earlier project are available [here](https://github.com/jplate/jPasi) under the MIT license.
